alphasmanifesto
===============

Wordpress theme for Alpha's Manifesto. You can see it live working on [http://blog.alphasmanifesto.com](http://blog.alphasmanifesto.com). More info to come later.

## About the icons

The icons for the dock menu are retrieved dynamically based on the category name. Of course, the ones present here are named based on my blog's categories.

They were created by [Tassy](http://tassy.deviantart.com). Props and thanks to her.

## Custom fields

This theme makes use of the `subtitle` custom field on each of the posts. The subtitle appears next to the title of each of the posts, and as a sub-header to the page when seeing a post page.
