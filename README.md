alphasmanifesto
===============

Wordpress theme for Alpha's Manifesto. You can see it live working on [http://blog.alphasmanifesto.com](http://blog.alphasmanifesto.com). More info to come later.

## About the icons

The icons for the dock menu are retrieved dynamically based on the category name. Of course, the ones present here are named based on my blog's categories.

They were created by [Tassy](http://tassy.deviantart.com). Props to her.

## Third Party Libraries

Libraries used in this theme:

* jquery
* jQuery doc
* 1140 grid system
* reset.css
* WordPress core Backup Script (not really part of the theme but I just had it laying around)
